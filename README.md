# Depth Of Layer Predictor Apparatus

Depth Of Layer Predictor Apparatus (DOLPA) is a set of machine learning regressor models trained to predict the ‘depth of layer’ (DOL) in ion-exchangeable glasses based on the physical and chemical properties used in experimental setups.

Ion-exchangeable glasses are a type of glass that can undergo a process of ion exchange, which is a chemical reaction that involves the exchange of ions between the glass and a molten salt or a solution. Ion exchange can modify the physical and optical properties of the glass, such as its strength, refractive index, color, and transparency. Ion-exchangeable glasses are often used for applications that require high performance and durability, such as touch screens, optical amplifiers, lasers, and sensors.

The depth of layer (DOL) in ion-exchangeable glasses is a measure of how deep the glass surface is modified by a process of ion exchange, which involves swapping smaller ions in the glass with larger ions from a salt or a solution. The ion exchange can enhance the strength, durability, and optical properties of the glass by creating a compressive stress layer and altering the refractive index of the glass. The depth of layer depends on several factors, such as the composition of the glass, the type and concentration of the salt or solution, and the duration and temperature of the ion exchange process. Typically, the depth of layer ranges from 20 to 150 microns, depending on the desired effect and application of the ion-exchangeable glass.

This repository contains the full implementation of DOLPA and the replication packages including comprehensive DOL datasets and various machine-learning experiments with manipulated parameters.
